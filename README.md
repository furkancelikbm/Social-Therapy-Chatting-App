This project is a Q&A-style mobile application developed using XML-based UI and Kotlin, designed specifically for users with a verified university email address. The goal of the application is to create a closed academic community where students can ask and answer questions within a secure environment.

The application features a multi-step authentication system to ensure that only eligible university members can register and participate. The sign-up process includes:

✅ Email Domain Verification: Users can only register with a verified university email domain (e.g., @university.edu)

✅ Email Link Verification: A confirmation link is sent to the university email to complete registration

✅ OTP Authentication: A one-time password (OTP) is used to enhance login security

Once registered and verified, users can set up their profile, start chat-based Q&A sessions, and interact with others via a real-time messaging interface.

Use Case Example:
A student from @university.edu signs up using their university email. They verify it via a confirmation link and enter the OTP sent to them. After setting up their profile, they can browse questions, ask new ones, and answer others through a chat-like interface — all within a secure, student-only space.
